# Lab-6-Applications-of-Parallel-Loops
The primary work of this lab is going through the pages and practices at:  
[Monte Carlo Simulations and More](http://selkie.macalester.edu/csinparallel/modules/MonteCarloSimulationExemplar/build/html/index.html)  

In addition to reading and working through the materials at the link above, there are a few deliverables and questions to answer as you work through the given directions.  

The link to seeing a real-world application of Monte Carlo simulation (or it's near equivalent) on the first page is broken. Instead, you can read about FogBugz usage here: [FogBugz Support: Evidence-Based Scheduling](https://support.fogbugz.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011258994-Evidence-Based-Scheduling-EBS-)  

Deliverables:
1. Questions.MD - With answers!
2. Roulette Simulation with unique seeds for each thread (last page of site)
